Answers to all the documentation requirements below.

Your README.md should have a separate heading for each documentation requirement and answers organised under the appropriate headings.

Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to.

Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.






Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
<b> FEATURES and Explanation: </b>

- User can start the quiz by pressing a specific a key on your keyboard
- User can see a question and 3 options are printed alongside 
- After selecting an answer, the next question is displayed 
Practice Mode: Users can choose between different categories, such as road signs, traffic rules, and driving techniques, to focus their study. Each category consists of multiple-choice questions similar to those in an actual driver's test.

- Timer: LetsDrive includes a timer to simulate the time constraints of a real driver's test. Users can set the duration they wish to allocate for each practice session, allowing them to improve their speed and time management skills.

- Feedback and Progress: After answering a question, the app provides instant feedback, indicating whether the chosen answer is correct or incorrect. If the user selects an incorrect answer, LetsDrive offers a hint to guide them towards the right choice. Users can track their progress through a visual representation of their overall performance and review their scores for each session.

- Scoring System: At the end of each practice session, LetsDrive displays the user's final score, indicating the number of correct answers. This information helps users evaluate their performance and identify areas that require further improvement.

- Pass Requirement: LetsDrive calculates the minimum number of correct answers needed to pass a driver's test in the user's jurisdiction. After each practice session, the app informs users about how many more correct answers they need to achieve to meet the passing criteria.

- Progress Tracking: LetsDrive maintains a user profile that stores performance history, allowing users to track their progress at the end which presents a comprehensive overview of past sessions, scores, and areas of improvement, enabling users to focus on weak points.

Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling






Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .

Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan. 
> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.


Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.
You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
- how to use any command line arguments made for the application
